Import the MASS library into R and use the "painters" and "faithful" datasets. Perform the following operations in R:
a) View data sets
b) Determine the distribution of school school frequencies in the pictorial data set and the eruption times in the "faithful" data set,
c) Graphical representation by two separate methods of information in the two sets of data
d) Determine the average, median, variance, and quartz relative to the ramp times in the "believers" dataset, then compile the boxplot
e) Determine the correlation coefficient for the two variables in the "faithful" data set
