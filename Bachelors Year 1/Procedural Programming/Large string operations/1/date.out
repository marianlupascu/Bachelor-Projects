the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide

worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

article 
a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and it was taken offline was decommissioned in as part of a deal between the government and international organizations such as the to end operations at the plant personally turned off in an official ceremony shutting down the entire site
waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically

the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment

cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests
also 
the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time

and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

the accident was reflected in the outcome of the referendum a result of that referendum began phasing out its nuclear power plants in a decision that was effectively reversed in referendum in reiterated strong objections to nuclear power thus abrogating the decision of 
the accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry after several states had already created such a post minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well which the current minister still holds as of events are also credited with strengthening the power movement which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the government

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from 
reported that in a total of livestock in needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter in order to ensure that their meat was safe for human consumption was due to residual radioactivity from in the plants they graze on in the wild during the summer sheep needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter during and these sheep were located in just of municipalities a decrease of from the municipalities affected animals were located in during municipalities were affected during 
of were expected to be seen for a further years although the severity of the effects would decline over that period report this is due to radioactive caesium isotopes being taken up by fungi such as caperatus which is in turn eaten by sheep whilst grazing
was forced to restrict the movement of sheep from upland areas when radioactive caesium fell across parts of and northern the immediate aftermath of the disaster in a total of sheep had their movement restricted across a total of farms in order to prevent contaminated meat entering the human food number of sheep and the number of farms affected has decreased since was released from all restrictions in and by farms containing around sheep remained under the restrictions in and northern restrictions applying in were lifted in whilst those applying to and were lifted during meaning no farms in the remain restricted because of fallout
legislation used to control sheep movement and compensate farmers were latterly compensated per animal to cover additional costs in holding animals prior to radiation monitoring was revoked during and by the relevant authorities in the

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years

the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and it was taken offline was decommissioned in as part of a deal between the government and international organizations such as the to end operations at the plant personally turned off in an official ceremony shutting down the entire site
waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion

the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the

in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests
also 
the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time

and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

the accident was reflected in the outcome of the referendum a result of that referendum began phasing out its nuclear power plants in a decision that was effectively reversed in referendum in reiterated strong objections to nuclear power thus abrogating the decision of 
the accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry after several states had already created such a post minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well which the current minister still holds as of events are also credited with strengthening the power movement which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the government

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from 
reported that in a total of livestock in needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter in order to ensure that their meat was safe for human consumption was due to residual radioactivity from in the plants they graze on in the wild during the summer sheep needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter during and these sheep were located in just of municipalities a decrease of from the municipalities affected animals were located in during municipalities were affected during 
of were expected to be seen for a further years although the severity of the effects would decline over that period report this is due to radioactive caesium isotopes being taken up by fungi such as caperatus which is in turn eaten by sheep whilst grazing
was forced to restrict the movement of sheep from upland areas when radioactive caesium fell across parts of and northern the immediate aftermath of the disaster in a total of sheep had their movement restricted across a total of farms in order to prevent contaminated meat entering the human food number of sheep and the number of farms affected has decreased since was released from all restrictions in and by farms containing around sheep remained under the restrictions in and northern restrictions applying in were lifted in whilst those applying to and were lifted during meaning no farms in the remain restricted because of fallout
legislation used to control sheep movement and compensate farmers were latterly compensated per animal to cover additional costs in holding animals prior to radiation monitoring was revoked during and by the relevant authorities in the

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years

the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and it was taken offline was decommissioned in as part of a deal between the government and international organizations such as the to end operations at the plant personally turned off in an official ceremony shutting down the entire site
waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion

the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the

in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests
also 
the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time

and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

the accident was reflected in the outcome of the referendum a result of that referendum began phasing out its nuclear power plants in a decision that was effectively reversed in referendum in reiterated strong objections to nuclear power thus abrogating the decision of 
the accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry after several states had already created such a post minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well which the current minister still holds as of events are also credited with strengthening the power movement which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the government

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from 
reported that in a total of livestock in needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter in order to ensure that their meat was safe for human consumption was due to residual radioactivity from in the plants they graze on in the wild during the summer sheep needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter during and these sheep were located in just of municipalities a decrease of from the municipalities affected animals were located in during municipalities were affected during 
of were expected to be seen for a further years although the severity of the effects would decline over that period report this is due to radioactive caesium isotopes being taken up by fungi such as caperatus which is in turn eaten by sheep whilst grazing
was forced to restrict the movement of sheep from upland areas when radioactive caesium fell across parts of and northern the immediate aftermath of the disaster in a total of sheep had their movement restricted across a total of farms in order to prevent contaminated meat entering the human food number of sheep and the number of farms affected has decreased since was released from all restrictions in and by farms containing around sheep remained under the restrictions in and northern restrictions applying in were lifted in whilst those applying to and were lifted during meaning no farms in the remain restricted because of fallout
legislation used to control sheep movement and compensate farmers were latterly compensated per animal to cover additional costs in holding animals prior to radiation monitoring was revoked during and by the relevant authorities in the

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

and evacuation
evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years

the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the 
of radioactivity in fish resulted in concentrations in western and in the former that in many cases were significantly above guideline maximum levels for consumption maximum levels for radiocaesium in fish vary from country to country but are approximately in the the in concentrations in fish were several thousand during the years after the accident
small lakes in and the region of concentrations in a number of fish species varied from to during the period contamination of fish caused concern in parts of the and and in the long term rather than months in the affected areas of and as well as in parts of 

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal
normal robot sent into the reactor itself has returned with samples of black radiotrophic fungi that are growing on the walls
the wild boar killed in the hunting season in over were found to be contaminated with levels of radiation above the permitted limit of becquerels per kilogram due to residual radioactivity from

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and it was taken offline was decommissioned in as part of a deal between the government and international organizations such as the to end operations at the plant personally turned off in an official ceremony shutting down the entire site
waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

disaster also referred to as the accident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on in the light water graphite moderated reactor at the near in what was then part of the of the 
a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and 
accident dominates the accidents of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history both in terms of cost and casualties is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level event maximum classification on the the other being the nuclear disaster in in struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were at many times falsely perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings ultimately involved over workers and cost an estimated billion rubles the accident blast effects caused deaths within the facility and later firemen and employees died in the afterward from acute radiation syndrome with the potential for cancers still being investigated
remains of the reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus shield by at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold phase the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station with continuing to produce electricity into 
accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining reactors in the family of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion

the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time
effects
and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity
and fauna
the disaster four square kilometres of pine forest directly downwind of the reactor turned and died earning the name of the animals in the areas also died or stopped reproducing domestic animals were removed from the exclusion zone but horses left on an island in the km mi from the power plant died when their thyroid glands were destroyed by radiation doses of cattle on the same island died and those that survived were stunted because of thyroid damage next generation appeared to be normal

also due to the disaster
the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the

in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source

and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions
requests
also 
the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

up most reports on the accident refer to a number of graphite fires it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned to the website is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of charcoal and coal tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn graphites the same source states played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident red glow observed during the accident was the expected color of luminescence for graphite at and not a graphite fire as some have incorrectly assumed nuclear physicist noted some weeks after the accident that now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an incandescent state is all the heat that was generated inside the uranium which would normally be extracted by coolant pumps in an undamaged reactor was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it to glow is contrary to the oft cited interpretation which is that the graphite was chiefly because it was chemically oxidizing with the air

a hurried late night stress test in which safety systems were deliberately turned off a combination of inherent reactor design flaws together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the stress test eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent graphite produced considerable updrafts for about days that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot phase approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion all of this radioactive material would then go on to onto much of the surface of the western and

disaster began during a systems test on at reactor number four of the plant which is near and in proximity to the administrative border with and the was a sudden and unexpected power surge and when an emergency shutdown was attempted a much larger spike in power output occurred which led to a reactor vessel rupture and a series of steam explosions events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air causing it to resulting fire sent week long plumes of highly radioactive fallout into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area including plumes drifted over large parts of the western and to official data about of the fallout landed in 
hours after the accident officials enacted a exclusion zone which resulted in the rapid evacuation of people and their animals primarily from the largest population centre near the reactor the town of not communicated at the time an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy nuclear fallout deposited on it while up to around that point the town itself was comparatively safe due to the more favourable wind direction permitting shelter in place to be the best safety measure to take for the town before the winds began to change direction
the plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated the evacuation zone was increased from to km about one week after the accident resulting in a further evacuated including from the town of itself surveying and detection of isolated fallout hotspots outside this zone over the following year eventually resulted in evacuees in total accepting to be moved near tripling in the total number of permanently resettled to some over the decades to from the most severely areas is regarded as largely political in nature with the majority of the rest evacuated in an effort to redeem loss in trust in the government which was most common around thousands of these evacuees would have been off staying home analysis has determined that the still living unofficially in the abandoned lands around have a lower risk of dying as a result of the elevated doses of radiation in the rural areas than they were exposed to the air pollution health risk in a large city such as nearby 
and have been burdened with the continuing and substantial decontamination and monthly compensation costs of the accident certain initiatives are legitimate as the director of the noted industry has been built on this unfortunate event with a interest in creating a false picture
picture
rate of new construction builds for civilian reactors dropped in the late with the effects of accidents having a chilling effect of was formed as a direct result of the accident with the aim of creating a greater exchange of information on safety and on techniques to increase the capacity of energy production
accident raised the already heightened concerns about fission reactors worldwide and while most concern was focused on those of the same unusual design hundreds of disparate reactor proposals including those under construction at reactor and were eventually cancelled the worldwide issue generally being due to the ballooning in costs for new nuclear reactor safety system standards and the legal costs in dealing with the increasingly public opinion was a precipitous drop in the prior rate of new after 
accident also raised concerns about the cavalier safety culture in the nuclear power industry slowing industry growth and forcing the government to become less secretive about its government coverup of the disaster was a for glasnost which the way for reforms leading to the collapse
projections
projections report by the examines the environmental consequences of the accident agency has estimated a global collective dose of radiation exposure from the accident on average to additional days of world exposure to natural background radiation individual doses were far higher than the global mean among those most exposed including primarily male recovery workers who averaged an effective dose equivalent to an extra years of typical natural background radiation exposure each of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide and whether the deaths are immediate short term or long term
deaths are directly attributed to the accident all among the reactor staff and emergency workers report places the total confirmed deaths from radiation at as of predicts the eventual death toll could reach among those exposed to the highest levels of radiation emergency workers evacuees and residents of the most contaminated areas this figure is a total causal death toll prediction combining the deaths of approximately emergency workers who died soon after the accident from acute radiation syndrome nine children who have died of thyroid cancer and a future predicted total of deaths from cancer and leukaemia
a paper in the of in the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of following a different conclusion methodology to the study which arrived at the total predicted death toll of after cancer survival rates were factored in they stated without entering into a discussion on deaths that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident
risk projections suggest that by now may have caused about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers in representing about of all incident cancers since the accident predict that by about cases of thyroid cancer and cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes
terms of non estimates based on a simple linear model multiplication that the on states not be done two advocacy groups have publicised mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation of estimates that among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide excluding thyroid cancer there will be an eventual excess cancer cases resulting in excess cancer deaths
similar lines the report commissioned by the political party predicts an eventual to excess cancer deaths in total around the globe
founder of that chapter of authored a book titled of the for and the which suggests that among the billions of people worldwide who were exposed to radioactive contamination from the disaster nearly a million premature cancer deaths occurred between and itself advocates a figure of at least or more book has failed the peer review process the five reviews published in the academic press four considered the book severely flawed and contradictory and one praised it while noting some shortcomings review by published by the of concludes that the report is of negative value because it has very little scientific merit while being highly misleading to the lay reader characterized the estimate of nearly a million deaths as more in the realm of science fiction than science

at reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase leading to explosions in its core dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere and caused an fire fire increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke as the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard containment vessel accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test a potential safety emergency core cooling feature which took place during a normal shutdown procedure
turbine tests
steady state operation a significant fraction of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the decay heat of its accumulated fission products heat continues for some time after the chain reaction is stopped following an emergency and active cooling may be required to prevent core damage reactors like those at use water as a coolant at consisted of about individual fuel channels each required a coolant flow of metric tons litres or gallons per hour
cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a in the event of a power grid failure reactors had three backup diesel generators these could start up in seconds but took seconds to attain full speed and reach the megawatt output required to run one main pump
solve this gap considered an unacceptable safety risk it had been theorized that rotational energy from the steam turbine it wound down under residual steam pressure could be used to generate the required electrical power indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for seconds bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators
capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully initial test carried out in indicated that the excitation voltage of the was insufficient it did not maintain the desired magnetic field after the turbine trip system was modified and the test was repeated in but again proved unsuccessful the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results test procedure would be repeated again in and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of 
test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor or the scientific manager it was approved only by the director of the plant even this approval was not consistent with established procedures
to the test parameters the thermal output of the reactor should have been no lower than at the start of the experiment test conditions had been as planned the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started which was inconsistent with approved procedure
power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first seconds of a total loss of electric power and thus lacked an important safety feature station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the nuclear oversight regulator though there was a representative at the complex of 
experimental procedure was intended to run as follows
reactor was to be running at a low power level between and 
generator was to be run up to full speed
these conditions were achieved the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off
generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically
the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down
before the accident
conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures special team of electrical engineers was present to test the new voltage regulating system planned a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at on and the power level had reached of its nominal thermal level by the beginning of the day shift
this point another regional power station unexpectedly went offline and the electrical grid controller requested that the further reduction of output be postponed as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand plant director agreed and postponed the test this delay preparations for the test not affecting the power were carried out including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or a system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a accident the other events that unfolded the system would have been of limited use but its disabling as a step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test addition had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test
the grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume delay had some serious consequences the day shift had long since departed the evening shift was also preparing to leave and the night shift would not take over until midnight well into the job to plan the test should have been finished during the day shift and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise plant
night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment further rapid decrease in the power level from was executed during the shift was chief of the night shift and was the operator responsible for the operational regimen including the movement of the control rods was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months
test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor to a thermal level of output of was reached at on to the production of a fission byproduct xenon which is a neutron absorber core power continued to decrease without further operator process known as reactor poisoning continuing decrease in power occurred because in steady state operation xenon is off as quickly as it is created from decaying iodine by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable xenon the reactor power was lowered previously produced high quantities of iodine decayed into the xenon faster than the reduced neutron flux could burn it off the reactor power output dropped further to approximately mistakenly inserted the control rods too exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because and both died in the hospital on and respectively combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended state with a power output of thermal or less
reactor was now producing percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at a much smaller value than the planned rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown and the subsequent operation at a level of less than led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon restricted any further rise of reactor power and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning
operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow and possibly by instability of neutron flux which triggered alarms control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the separator drums and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water as well as from relief valves opened to relieve excess steam into a turbine condenser and from the neutron power controller and emergency alarm signals concerning parameters were ignored apparently to preserve the reactor power level
the power level of was achieved preparation for the experiment continued part of the test plan extra water pumps were activated at on increasing the water flow increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers which now more closely approached the nucleate boiling temperature of water reducing the safety margin
flow exceeded the allowed limit at triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators the same time the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators water weakly absorbs neutrons the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow in an effort to increase steam pressure and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power
these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration all of the control rods were removed manually including all but of the manually operated rods of the minimal which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant out of a total control rods the emergency system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually the button the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers anything pushed it into supercriticality it was unable to recover automatically
and explosion
explosion
the experiment began of the main circulating pumps were active of the eight total six are normally active during regular operation steam to the turbines was shut off beginning a of the turbine generator diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads the generators were to have completely picked up the power needs by the interim the power for the was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down the momentum of the turbine generator decreased so did the power it produced for the pumps water flow rate decreased leading to increased formation of steam voids in the core
of the positive void coefficient of the reactor at low reactor power levels it was now primed to embark on a positive feedback loop in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water coolant to absorb neutrons which in turn increased the power output caused yet more water to flash into steam giving a further power increase almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback inserting control rods into the reactor core to limit the power rise system had control of only rods and nearly all others had been manually retracted
as recorded by the centralized control system an emergency shutdown of the reactor was initiated was started when the button known as the button of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier reason why the button was pressed is not known whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment
is a view that the may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase although there is no recorded data proving this have suggested that the button was not pressed and instead the signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system the registered a manual signal spite of this the question as to when or even whether the button was pressed has been the subject of debate are assertions that the pressure was caused by the rapid power acceleration at the start and allegations that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to but others assert that it happened earlier and in calm conditions
the button was pressed the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at so that the rods took to seconds to travel the full height of the core about metres bigger problem was the design of the control rods which had graphite neutron moderators attached to boost reactor output when the rod was withdrawn displacers had a m column of water above and below them when the rods were at maximum extration and lowering the rods displaced the water in the lower portion of the reactor with moderating graphite a result the increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite displaced the coolant behaviour was known after the initial insertion of control rods in another reactor at in induced a power spike but as the subsequent of that reactor was successful the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance
importance few seconds after the start of the a power spike occurred and the core overheated causing some of the fuel rods to fracture blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at insertion with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core three seconds the reactor output rose above 
subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure caused the fuel cladding to fail releasing the fuel elements into the coolant and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located
according to some estimations the reactor jumped to around thermal ten times the normal operational output last reading on the control panel was was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building but a steam explosion like the explosion of a steam boiler from excess vapour pressure appears to have been the next event is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the exterior cooling structure that caused the detonation that destroyed the reactor casing tearing off and blasting the upper plate to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened through the roof of the reactor building is believed to be the first explosion that many explosion ruptured further fuel channels as well as severing most of the coolant lines feeding the reactor chamber and as a result the remaining coolant flashed to steam and escaped the reactor core total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the thermal power
power second more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the nuclear chain reaction explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air greatly contributing to the spread of radioactive fallout and the contamination of outlying areas
to observers outside burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire percent of the graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite source needed
the larger explosion a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage one such survivor recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall he saw a beautiful beam of light bluish light caused by the ionization of air that appeared to up into infinity
were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion view was that the second explosion was caused by hydrogen which had been produced either by the overheated reaction or by the reaction of graphite with steam that produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide hypothesis was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of fast neutrons caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core third hypothesis was that the explosion was a second steam explosion to this version the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building
force of the second explosion and the ratio of xenon radioisotopes released during the event indicate that the second explosion could have been a nuclear power transient the result of the melting core material in the absence of its cladding water coolant and moderator undergoing runaway prompt criticality similar to the explosion of a fizzled nuclear weapon nuclear excursion released billion joules of energy the equivalent of about ten tons of analysis indicates that the nuclear excursion was limited to a small portion of the core
to safety regulations bitumen a combustible material had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor which was still operating was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor reactor the chief of the night shift wanted to shut down the reactor immediately but chief engineer would not allow this operators were given respirators and potassium iodide tablets and told to continue working made his own decision to shut down the reactor leaving only those operators there who had to work the emergency cooling systems
levels
radiation intensity levels at different locations at reactor site shortly after the explosion are shown in the below table dose of roentgens delivered over five hours is usually lethal for human beings
layout
levels
radiation levels in the areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be roentgens per second equivalent to more than roentgens per hour lethal dose is around roentgens over hours so in some areas unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute a dosimeter capable of measuring up to was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building and another one failed when turned on remaining dosimeters had limits of and therefore read scale the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above while the true levels were much higher in some areas
of the inaccurate low readings the reactor crew chief assumed that the reactor was intact evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor of them wore any protective gear including died from radiation exposure within three weeks
containment
after the accident firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires on the scene was a firefighter brigade under the command of who died on of acute radiation sickness were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular electrical fire know it was the reactor one had told us
the driver of one of the fire engines later described what happened
arrived there at or minutes to two in the morning saw graphite scattered about asked that graphite kicked it away one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up hot he said pieces of graphite were of different sizes some big some small enough to pick them up
know much about radiation those who worked there had no idea was no water left in the trucks filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top those boys who died went up to the roof and others and went up the ladder and never saw them again
a fireman stationed in since offers a different description in 
remember joking to the others must be an incredible amount of radiation here be lucky if all still alive in the morning
also said
course we knew followed regulations we would never have gone near the reactor it was a moral obligation our duty were like kamikaze
immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing to protect and keep its core cooling systems intact fires were extinguished by but many firefighters received high doses of radiation fire inside reactor continued to burn until it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out
fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over metric tons of sand lead clay and boron onto the burning reactor and injection of liquid nitrogen filmmaker captured film footage of an helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its crew is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core
eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died reported on the television series one described his experience of the radiation as like metal and feeling a sensation similar to that of pins and needles all over his face is similar to the description given by a physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a criticality accident
explosion and fire threw hot particles of the nuclear fuel and also far more dangerous fission products radioactive isotopes such as caesium iodine strontium and other radionuclides into the air the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion
assembled included bulldozers and that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris deputy director of the of in said in we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything there was very high radiation the robot ceased to be a electronics quit working

evacuation
view of taken from the city of 
nearby city of was not immediately evacuated townspeople went about their usual business completely oblivious to what had just happened within a few hours of the explosion dozens of people fell ill they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting
the plant was run by authorities in the government of did not receive prompt information on the accident then of the of of the recalls that acting of phoned her at work at am to report current affairs only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant but it was extinguished and everything was fine asked are the people he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about are celebrating a wedding others are gardening and others are fishing in the then spoke over the phone to of the of the and de facto head of state who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the of of 
commission was set up the same day to investigate the accident was headed by of the of and included leading nuclear specialist radiologist and others flew to and arrived at the power plant in the evening of that time two people had already died and were hospitalized delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure the early hours of over hours after the initial blast they ordered the evacuation of it was decided to evacuate the population for three days later this was made permanent
on buses had arrived in to start the evacuation evacuation began at translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows
the attention of the residents of informs you that due to the accident at in the city of the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible the children being top priority we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of region these reasons starting from pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal supervised by the police and the city officials is highly advisable to take your documents some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food just in case with you senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in to maintain these facilities in a good working order the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights electrical equipment and water and shut the windows keep calm and orderly in the process of this evacuation
announcement in 
expedite the evacuation residents were told to bring only what was necessary and that it would only last approximately three days a result most personal belongings were left behind and remain there today people were evacuated to various villages of the region next day talks began for evacuating people from the km zone days after the accident the evacuation area was expanded to km mi zone has remained ever since although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded
evacuations actually had some economic benefit moving people to areas of labour shortage in and 
began long before the accident was publicly known throughout the on after radiation levels set off alarms at the in over kilometres mi from the did the publicly admit that an accident had occurred that evening a announcement was read in the news programme 
has been an accident at the of the nuclear reactors was damaged effects of the accident are being remedied has been provided for any affected people investigative commission has been set up

was the entirety of the announcement of the accident of the then discussed and other nuclear accidents an example of the common tactic of emphasizing foreign disasters when one occurred in the mention of a commission however indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy
the same time released its report about the disaster
was the first of the state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on she spoke with members of medical staff and people who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes returned home near midnight stopping at a radiological checkpoint in one of the first that were set up soon after the accident
was a notification from that there was no reason to postpone the celebrations in the annual parade but on a meeting of the bureau of the of took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration were reporting that the radiological background in city was normal the meeting which was finished at it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular to under hours
buildings in were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant included the which closed in and the which closed in 
explosion risk
floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe the third floor above them below the reactor served as a steam tunnel steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water the disaster the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water and constituted a serious steam explosion risk
smoldering graphite fuel and other material above at more than started to burn through the reactor floor and mixed with molten concrete from the reactor lining creating corium a radioactive material comparable to lava this mixture had melted through the floor into the pool of water it was feared it could have created a serious steam explosion that would have ejected more radioactive material from the reactor became necessary to drain the pool
bubbler pool could be drained by opening its sluice gates the valves controlling it were underwater located in a flooded corridor in the basement volunteers in wetsuits and respirators protection against radioactive aerosols and equipped with dosimeters entered the radioactive water and managed to open the valves were the engineers and knew where the valves were accompanied by the shift supervisor succeeding and emerging from the water according to many language news articles books and the prominent docudrama the three knew it was a and began suffering from radiation sickness and died soon after sources also incorrectly claimed that they died there in the plant research by author of the book determined that the frequently recounted story is a gross exaggeration continues to work in the nuclear energy industry and rebuffs the growth of the media sensationalism surrounding was found to still be alive by the elderly year old had lived until and died of heart failure
the bubbler pool gates were opened by the team fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement operation was not completed until after metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out
the bubbler pool gone a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion do so the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the reactor reduce the likelihood of this it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor which would also stabilize the foundations oil drilling equipment the injection of liquid nitrogen began on was estimated that metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete
is likely that intense alpha radiation hydrolysed the water generating a hydrogen peroxide solution akin to an oxidizing acid of bubbler pool water to is confirmed by the presence in the lavas of studtite and metastudtite the only minerals that contain peroxide
removal
worst of the radioactive debris was collected inside what was left of the reactor much of it shoveled in by liquidators wearing heavy protective gear by the military these workers could only spend a maximum of seconds at a time working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris reactor itself was covered with bags of sand lead and boric acid dropped from helicopters some metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident
the time there was still fear that the reactor could a nuclear and explode again and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion and to prevent further release of radioactive material was the largest civil engineering task in history involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation a large concrete sarcophagus had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents unique up medal was given to the workers
of the vehicles used by the liquidators remain parked in a field in the area
the construction of the sarcophagus a scientific team the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion scientists manually collected cold fuel rods but great heat was still emanating from the core of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust
six months of investigation in they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons which they called foot for its wrinkled appearance mass was composed of sand glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot and was breached by solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed chernobylite was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion
worked under deplorable conditions poorly informed and with poor protections if not most of them exceeded radiation safety limits exceeded limits by over to rapid death
official contaminated zones became stage to a massive effort lasting seven months official reason for such early dangerous decontamination efforts rather than allowing time for natural decay was that the land must be and brought back into cultivation within fifteen months of the land was under cultivation even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled forces must have done much of the work this land was of marginal agricultural value to historian the administration had a psychological purpose for the they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy and even to restart the power station

were two official explanations of the accident
error
first official explanation of the accident later acknowledged to be erroneous was published in effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators investigate the causes of the accident the created a group known as the which in its report of on the whole also supported this view based on the data provided by the and the oral statements of specialists this view the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations preparation and testing of the turbine generator under conditions using the auxiliary load personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise
operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of nuclear reactor physics and engineering as well as lack of experience and training to these allegations at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off most notably the control system and power reduction system had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion
developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff
this analysis of the causes of the accident deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident following general picture arose from these observations procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night
reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators which the test was really about main process computer was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power the reactor would have started to insert all of the control rods computer would have also started the that introduces control rods into the active zone within seconds which is still slow by standards control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators
the subject of the disconnection of safety systems said in that was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight
view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the accident that appeared immediately after the accident and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications
instructions and design deficiencies found
the control rods having graphite tips that moderated and therefore increased the fission rate in the beginning of the rod insertion reinforced containment building
has declassified a number of documents from the period between and related to the plant mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant as splitting of concrete layers that were never acted upon document over emergency situations in the plant during this period of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel
a of the for the of in and reassessed the causes and circumstances of the accident and came to new insights and conclusions on it in the published an additional report which reviewed part of the report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident and was included the report as 
this report most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous based on incorrect information obtained in or less relevant report reflected another view of the main reasons for the accident presented in to this account the operators actions in turning off the interfering with the settings on the protection equipment and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude although they may have been a breach of regulations off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations
factors contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster included operating the reactor at a low power than level documented in the test programme and operating with a small operational reactivity margin assertions of experts notwithstanding regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level
regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the is reflected in the and design documentation for the is extremely contradictory and furthermore was not treated as an operational safety limit violation of which could lead to an accident
to the the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor are two such reasons
reactor had a dangerously large positive void coefficient of reactivity void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant other reactor designs have a negative coefficient the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases fewer neutrons are slowed down neutrons are less likely to split uranium atoms so the reactor produces less power negative feedback reactor however used solid graphite as a neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons and the water in it on the contrary acts like a harmful neutron absorber neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms increasing the power output makes the design very unstable at low power levels and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level behaviour is and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew
crew more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction the reactor design the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was metres shorter than necessary and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water upper part of the rod the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction was made of boron carbide this design when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position the graphite parts initially displace some water absorbs neutrons as mentioned above effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially for the first few seconds of control rod activation reactor power output is increased rather than reduced as desired behaviour is and was not known to the reactor operators
deficiencies besides these were noted in the reactor design as were its with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety
of views
views were heavily lobbied by different groups including the designers power plant personnel and the and governments to the analysis the main cause of the accident was the operators actions according to the revised analysis the main cause was the design reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the accident was that the primary data covering the disaster as registered by the instruments and sensors were not completely published in the official sources
again the human factor had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough witness the length of time for which the was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power view is that it was the operating deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame reprehensibly unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test
in the previously released report close attention is paid in report to the inadequate the moment of the accident of safety at all levels in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also and to no lesser extent during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants design engineering construction manufacture and regulation poor quality of operating procedures and instructions and their conflicting character put a heavy burden on the operating crew including the chief engineer accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture not only at the plant but throughout the design operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time

and international spread of radioactive substances
hundred times more radioactive material was released from than by the atomic bombing of disaster released to of the total amount of radioactivity released by nuclear weapons testing during the and km of land was significantly contaminated with fallout with the worst hit regions being in and levels of contamination were detected over all of except for the 
initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from sources but from the morning of at the km mi from the site were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes
was search for the source of radioactivity after they had determined there was no leak at the plant that at noon on led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western the evacuation of on hours after the initial explosions was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication
from the accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the the mountains and the where adiabatic cooling caused radioactive rainfall resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized and across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas and also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front bringing rain 
was purposely seeded over km of the by the air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas rain fell on the city of from and scientists indicate that received about of the contamination that fell on the former the report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside and large area in south of was also contaminated as were parts of northwestern in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation
published data from a monitoring program shows a decrease in internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of a region in close to may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules
precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others some officials stated that the accident had no adverse effects figures in southern in indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed needed
in both needed and other animals increased following the disaster farms in of for instance in the first four years of the disaster nearly animals were born with gross deformities such as missing or extra limbs missing eyes heads or ribs or deformed skulls in comparison only three abnormal births had been registered in the five years prior these claims the states conceived before or after their exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies
release
many other releases of radioactivity into the environment the release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core dangerous are the highly radioactive fission products those with high nuclear decay rates that accumulate in the food chain such as some of the isotopes of iodine caesium and strontium and caesium are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population
reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in and with the latter report updated in 
different times after the accident different isotopes were responsible for the majority of the external dose remaining quantity of any radioisotope and therefore the activity of that isotope after decay have passed is less than of its initial magnitude and it continues to reduce beyond after to remaining after have passed and so on radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive which is not accounted for here release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their boiling points and the majority of the radioactivity present in the core was retained in the reactor
of the noble gases including krypton and xenon contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere by the first steam explosion atmospheric release of xenon with a of days is estimated at 
to of all core radioiodine in the reactor about becquerels or about kg was released as a mixture of sublimed vapour solid particles and organic iodine compounds has a of days
days to of all core caesium was released in all was released in aerosol form caesium along with isotopes of strontium are the two primary elements preventing the exclusion zone being equals kilograms of caesium has a of years
hours an estimated was released
early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was this was later revised to corresponds to the atmospheric emission of t of fragmented fuel
sizes of particles were released small particles of to micrometres diameter and large particles of micrometres large particles contained about to of the released nonvolatile radioisotopes zirconium niobium lanthanum cerium and the transuranic elements including neptunium plutonium and the minor actinides embedded in a uranium oxide matrix
dose that was calculated is the relative external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a shelter and then venturing out to consume an internal dose from the inhalation or ingestion of a radioisotope requires a personnel specific radiation dose reconstruction analysis
radioactivity in the environment
lakes and reservoirs
nuclear power plant is located next to the which feeds into the reservoir system one of the largest surface water systems in which at the time supplied water to million residents and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident the most affected areas of levels of radioactivity from radionuclides and in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom an insoluble phase and would not dissolve for years for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to allowing most water to be reported as a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the cooling pond was within acceptable norms this two months after the disaster the water supply was abruptly switched from the to the massive silt traps were constructed along with an enormous underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the

was not badly affected by the accident since radionuclides with short decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies and radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were adsorbed to surface soils before they could transfer to groundwater significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from waste disposal sites in the km mi exclusion zone around there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites out of the km mi exclusion zone the argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of washout of radioactivity

the aftermath of the accident people suffered from acute radiation sickness of whom died within the first three months of the victims were fire and rescue workers trying to bring the accident under control who were not fully aware of how dangerous the exposure to radiation in the smoke was
the composed of the other organizations and the governments of and published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the accident
the death toll of the accident the report states that emergency workers died from acute radiation syndrome including beta burns and patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by may reach a total of about among the million persons residing in the contaminated areas the report projected cancer mortality of less than one per cent on a time span of years cautioning that this estimate was since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the disaster report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs report says it represents the consensus view of the eight organizations
all emergency workers by the only were reported by their government as having died contrast casualties were reported among workers up to the year by the for of the 
four most harmful radionuclides spread from were iodine caesium caesium and strontium with of days years years and years respectively iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes because of its short but it is highly volatile and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term on the other hand is the least volatile of the four and of main concern in the areas near itself tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands leading among other things to increased incidence of thyroid cancers tends to accumulate in vital organs such as the heart while strontium accumulates in bones and may thus be a risk to and is most damaging to cells that are actively dividing adult mammals cell division is slow except in hair follicles skin bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract which is why vomiting and hair loss are common symptoms of acute radiation sickness
in assessment
in and has shown disturbing trends following the disaster incidence of congenital defects had risen by within six years of the accident to the point that it became the principal cause of infant medical source was a substantial increase in digestive circulatory nervous respiratory and endocrine diseases and cancers correlated with areas of high radioactive contamination and in one especially contaminated district of of children were in reported to have at least one chronic illness source needed of estimated in that roughly of its population were unwell with large increases in respiratory blood and nervous system medical source the year the number of claiming to be radiation and receiving state benefits had jumped to million or of the population of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones or former or current plant workers to scientific bodies these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor and nutrition also they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed of cancer are now being registered
the approximately that were engaged in the roughly were required to work as in conditions of such extreme radiation that electronic robots ceased to operate are figures within every village housing block and are prematurely aged and many have died and leukaemia rates among them are substantially higher than in the wider medical source to medical source birth defects appear to have increased in as well describes gross deformities in the city neonatal unit including one infant born to a worker who had an extra finger a deformed ear his trachea missing and his gut external to his body staff were on the whole cooperative but warned that she would be forbidden to access any statistics she could therefore only treat these cases as anecdotal evidence or inaccessible statistics has meant that causal connections are very difficult to make in both and has been observed that in particular actively suppresses or ignores source needed a false economy estimated to cost the country ten times more than it saves describes had a year once when almost every day there was a funeral must have buried about fifty people that year it related to radiation medical source
rule the extent of radiation injury was systematically covered needed cases of acute radiation sickness were disguised as dystonia a classification for a type of panic disorder with possible symptoms including heart palpitations sweating tremors nausea hypotension or hypertension neurosis spasms and seizures symptoms which resemble the neurological effects of documents show that the ordered the systematic misdiagnosis of as for all people who did not show gross signs of radiation sickness such as burns or hair loss and for all who had exceeded their maximum allowable needed appears that up to people were intentionally misdiagnosed in this medical source claims for health welfare were denied on the basis of this diagnosis or the application of other psychosocial medical categories poor constitution psychological key tool for denial was the rem concept whereby it was held that rems was a safe radiation exposure for a lifetime on international standards and since most people near received less than that their health complaints could be attributed to medical source
and rely heavily on foreign aid and have been pressured to comply with international views of the disaster instance in the advised to its attention from calculating the impact of the accident to developing activities directed at economic development and improvement in the quality of life of the affected people government welfare was blamed for creating sense of victimization and dependency and thus exacerbating psychosomatic disorders in particular has complied by ignoring or suppressing scientific medical source medical source attributes this more to that weakness and apathy than a simple desire to avoid health costs
cancer
report revealed thyroid cancer among children to be one of the main health impacts from the accident that publication more than cases were reported and that there was no evidence of an increase in solid cancers or leukemia said that there was an increase in psychological problems among the affected manager of reported that the cases of thyroid cancer resulted in nine deaths
to up to the year an excess of over cases of thyroid cancer have been reported is over the estimated baseline thyroid cancer rate more than casual cases of thyroid cancer have been reported in children and adolescents exposed at the time of the accident a number that is expected to increase concluded that there is no other evidence of major health impacts from the radiation exposure
thyroid cancers are generally treatable and when treated the survival rate of thyroid cancer is and after years had reported deaths from thyroid cancer in also states that there has been no increase in the rate of birth defects or abnormalities or solid cancers as lung cancer corroborating assessments does raise the possibility of long term genetic defects pointing to a doubling of minisatellite mutations among children born in the risk of thyroid cancer associated with the accident is still high according to published studies
affiliate of the for the of argued that more than people are today affected by thyroid cancer and cases are expected in the future
health disorders
a radiation expert at the of puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at for a total of fatal cancers saying number is small a few percent relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer but the numbers are large in absolute terms same report outlined studies based in data found in the from to that suggested that workers exposed to an average dose of about of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure
report went into depth about the risks to mental health of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation to the the of the affected population as rather than has led them to perceive themselves as helpless weak and lacking control over their future says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects
commented that years later population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise addition disadvantaged children around suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the accident but also to the poor state of health systems
on the of part of the have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects was set up as a collaboration between various bodies including the after the atomic bomb attacks on and to assess the effects of radiation on human health
due to radiation exposure
number of potential deaths arising from the disaster is heavily debated prediction of future cancer deaths in surrounding countries is based on the model which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the dose epidemiologist contends that estimating health effects in a population from the model not wise because of the uncertainties
to the of the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide all contaminated areas is approximately based on the same 
study critical of the report was commissioned by which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in and the accident could have resulted in additional deaths in the period between and of the criticized the reliance on locally produced studies most of the sources were from journals including many medical journals the higher mortality estimates were from sources while for the suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology
of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed

of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building black brown and a porous ceramic lava materials are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials within them porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly
is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity to a series of published papers suggested that the of the lava would convert all metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid same paper states that the loss of uranium from the wrecked reactor is only kg lb per year this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment paper also states that when the shelter is improved the leaching rate of the lava will decrease

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter

the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

countries significant economic impact at the time was the removal of ha acres of agricultural land and ha acres of forest from production much of this has been returned to use agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques fertilizers and additives

the accident questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate work on the unfinished reactors and was halted three years later the trouble at the plant did not end with the disaster in reactor damaged reactor was sealed off and cubic meters cu yd of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational needed work was managed by the deputy chief engineer of and government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country

a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and it was taken offline was decommissioned in as part of a deal between the government and international organizations such as the to end operations at the plant personally turned off in an official ceremony shutting down the entire site
waste management
of the reactor
reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant
plant was to have been built by the end of however it has suffered ongoing delays and as of when construction finally began was expected to be completed in was delayed again to the end of the lifespan of the sarcophagus structure is being built adjacent to the existing shelter and will be slid into place on rails is to be a metal arch metres ft high and spanning metres ft to cover both unit and the hastily built structure set up in has received million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work and the also applied to decommissioning are managed by the for and needed
of has been covered by the that covers the reactor and the unstable huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site attended by the president diplomats and site workers
roughly workers were still working within the of maintaining the plant and performing other containment and tasks often in dangerous conditions handful of scientists work inside the sarcophagus but outsiders are rarely granted access an team led by reporter and producer were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for minutes and film inside the control room
a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed

authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created
very high doses it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies but unlike the dominant threshold model of radiation and cancer rate increases it was known by researchers familiar with both the prior human exposure data and animal testing that the of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose below which no rate increase is observed teratology defects issue was discussed by of the in publishing a detailed review of dose reconstructions and the available pregnancy data following the accident inclusive of data from two largest obstetrics hospitals concludes that lay press with newspaper reporters playing up anecdotal stories of children with birth defects is together with dubious studies that show selection bias the two primary factors causing the persistent belief that increased the background rate of birth defects the vast amount of pregnancy data does not support this preception as no women took part in the most radioactive liquidator operations no pregnant individuals were exposed to the threshold dose

to a of and member of the advisory committee the philosophy is overly conservative and radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed a radiation biologist at the of cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a public health policy
significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the accident large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care on stability and the manner in which statistical data is collected a radiation biologist at says that subsequent collapse scarce funding imprecise dosimetry and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability

is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster to the spent billion rubles equivalent of billion at that time on containment and decontamination virtually bankrupting itself the total cost over years is estimated at billion dollars costs are well known in their report stated that between and of government spending in is still related to while in over billion is thought to have been spent between and with of national budget having been in falling to by of the current cost relates to the payment of social benefits to some million people across the countries
countries significant economic impact at the time was the removal of ha acres of agricultural land and ha acres of forest from production much of this has been returned to use agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques fertilizers and additives

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed

of the for and the is an translation of the publication was published in by the of in their of the of presents an analysis of scientific literature and concludes that medical records between the year of the accident and reflect premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released it was impossible to precisely determine what dose the affected people received knowing the fact that the received doses varied strongly from one individual to the other in the population above which the radioactive cloud travelled and also knowing the fact that one cannot tell for sure if a cancer in an individual from the former is produced by radiation from accident or by other social or behavioural factors such as smoking or alcohol drinking
authors suggest that most of the deaths were in and though others occurred worldwide throughout the many countries that were struck by radioactive fallout from literature analysis draws on over published titles and over internet and printed publications discussing the consequences of the disaster authors contend that those publications and papers were written by leading authorities and have largely been downplayed or ignored by the and 
estimated human health impacts were criticized by of the of who described them as biased drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base expressed his opinion that authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the publications for example to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions

the accident journalists mistrusted many medical professionals as the spokesman from the and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them the continent in nations where abortion is legal many requests for induced abortions of otherwise normal pregnancies were obtained out of fears of radiation from including an excess number of abortions in in the months following the accident following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation it was determined that the effective dose to would not exceed mrem a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other effects there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in 
an estimated excess of about elective abortions may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of unfounded fears of radiation from according to and ultimately a article published by in the of which mentions but does not reference an source on the matter
available statistical data excludes the abortion rates as they are presently unavailable the available data an increase in the number of abortions in what were healthy developing human offspring in occurred in the months following the accident at a rate of about cases there was an observed excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated a above the expected number of induced abortions occurred approximately 
the increase in radiation in was so public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands more fetal deaths in than the accident underlines the importance of public debate the role of the mass media and of the way in which authorities participate in this debate
evidence of changes in the prevalence of birth congenital which might be associated with the accident are apparent in or the the two republics which had the highest exposure to fallout and where no increase in abortion rates occurred it was likewise determined that association between the temporal and spatial variations in radioactivity and variable incidence of congenital malformations found similar null increase in the abortion rate and a healthy baseline situation of no increase in birth defects was determined from assessing the also mirrored in western data sets approaching a million births in the database divided into and control groups were assessed in no impacts were detected the researchers conclude retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn fetus was not justified studies from and the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects in etc due to the anxieties created

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed

a m sq ft section of the roof of the adjacent to the sarcophagus collapsed first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it the amount of snow was not exceptional and the report of a panel concluded that the part collapse of the was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the added a larger strain on the total structure than expected and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding such as former deputy director of the nuclear plant did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition proposed reinforcement in was cancelled by a superior official the incident radioactivity levels were up to becquerels per cubic meter of air times normal report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed workers employed by the complex and the company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse to the managers of the complex radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels and and should not affect workers health to the situation was underestimated by the nuclear complex managers and information was kept secret
materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
the government announced a decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site

materials and waste management
of some fuel remained in the reactors at units through most of it in each spent fuel pool as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond 
a contract was signed for construction of a radioactive waste management facility to store used fuel assemblies from units and other operational wastes as well as material from decommissioning units will be the first units decommissioned anywhere contract included a processing facility able to cut the fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters which were to be filled with inert gas and welded shut
canisters were to be transported to dry storage vaults where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to years facility treating fuel assemblies per year would be the first of its kind for fuel after a significant part of the storage structures had been built technical deficiencies in the concept emerged and the contract was terminated in interim spent fuel storage facility will now be completed by others by needed
contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant to handle some cubic meters of low and liquid wastes at the site will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on needed
