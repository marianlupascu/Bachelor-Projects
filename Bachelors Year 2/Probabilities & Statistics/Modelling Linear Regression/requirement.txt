Use the Auto dataset in the MASS library to implement a linear regression model (choose the variables for which the regression model is suitable; visually test the links between the variables before making the choice !!). Estimate the regression parameters and comment on the results. Apply at least one method to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Use your model and make a prediction. Comment the code properly and interpret the results!
