% Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm for data with missing entries.
% The missing entries are simply ignored (masked). 
% Input:
%   Y     - training signals set
%   Ymask - varargin{1} = signal mask
%   D     - current dictionary
%   s     - sparsity level
%
% Output:
%   X     - sparse representations
